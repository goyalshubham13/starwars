# Problem Statement
Create a JavaScript application using any popular MV* framework or react-flux
architecture that has two pages as described below using API from the website http://
swapi.co
Please go through the documentation and API response carefully to chose the right set of
APIs and call them with the proper arguments.
The application is supposed to have 2 pages:
# Page 1 (Login Page)
Allow the user to login as a character from STAR WARS using the character name as the
username and birth year as the password.
eg:
Username: Luke Skywalker
Password : 19BBY
# Page 2 (Search Page)
Implement a type-along search which searches for planets and lists them in components
(eg: div) that are sized relative to their population on every keypress in the input field.
(eg: you can use a bigger font size for a planet with larger population, or even show a
bigger div for a planet with larger population)
Advanced:: Only the user Luke Skywalker should be able to make more than 15 searches
in a minute.
